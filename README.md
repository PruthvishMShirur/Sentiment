# Sentiment
Here is the complete project, we have used multiple models for sentiment analysis. Due to some constrictions of upload size in github, we could not upload everything. These are the minor changes. In the file multiclass.py these changes are to be made to run the model, change the directory in line 8 and 9 to where you have downloaded these files and modify the directory. 
The link for downloading those files is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ky9H_L2q2g2qTXzn6kWoCh2xrm-GpcOj?usp=sharing.
We have also added multi_sentiment_analysis.py file which had the follwing code.
